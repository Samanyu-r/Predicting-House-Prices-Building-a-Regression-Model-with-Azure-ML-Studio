# Predicting-House-Prices-Building-a-Regression-Model-with-Azure-ML-Studio

The main objective is to build and experiment with regression pipelines in Azure Machine Learning Studio.
The task is to create a predictive model in Azure ML Studio to predict the price of a house based on its features using different regression techniques. The supervised dataset contains seven variables:
•	House Sale Identifier – Categorical 
•	House Age - Numeric
•	SqFt - Numeric
•	Num Bathroom - Numeric
•	Num Bedrooms - Numeric
•	Average Income - Numeric
•	Sales Price – Numeric (Response Variable)

Deploying different regression techniques such as decision tree regression, decision forest regression, and linear regression can provide valuable insights into predicting the price of a house based on its features. Accurate predictions can be provided for individuals or businesses in the real estate industry by evaluating the performance of each model and selecting the best one.
